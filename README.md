# Cpp-Employee-base
<p align="justify">This is an employee base programme I've made to practice basic inheritance in C++. The exercise topic was written by ChatGPT, which I asked for some exercises concerning inheritance. <br><br>The topic was to create class structure as follows:<br><br>
1. Employee class  with three fields: name, surname and pension <br>
1. 1. Full-time employee class derived from Employee containing additional information about position of an employee<br>
1. 2. Hourly employee class derived from Employee containing information about hourly rate and amount of hours in a month that and employee has worked<br>
2. Employee base class to store employees, add or delete them from the base and print them on the screen<br><br>
Variable and class names are written in Polish, which is a flaw I'll soon correct.
